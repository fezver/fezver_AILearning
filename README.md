## Project Philosophy

> This isn't just an AI project — it's a reflection of how I learn, build, and iterate.  
> Fez AI Core is designed to grow with me — every update, every feature, every idea represents a new step in my journey toward mastering digital intelligence.

The AI doesn't think for me — it thinks *with* me.
